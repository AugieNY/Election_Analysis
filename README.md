# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Analysis
The objective of this exercise is to analyze and summarize the election data for a client. We are given a csv file (election_results) that will serve as database for the election analysis. We will use a python code to analyze and provide a winner (based on number of votes) of the election.

## Election Results
There are 3 counties and 3 candidates for this election where 369,711 votes were casted.
- For counties:
  - Arapahoe county casted the least part of the votes (6.7%) 
  - Denver casted the most (82.8%)
- For candidates:
  - Diana DeGette has the most votes in this election (73.8%)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane collected the least amount of votes (3.1%)
  - Charles Casper Stockham came second best with 23% of the votes.

## Election Audit Summary
The script used for the analysis can be used for any dataset. We will have to watch to make sure the dataset and headers follow the same order as used in the code (Candidate and county in order, etc).
If we add another layer in the code, we could do a classification of candidate by county. It may be interesting in a deeper analysis to cast the % of votes of each candidates per county (relative to participation).
